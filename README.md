## Favorite Project
I've worked on a lot of projects, but my favorite is definitely my OD scheduler.

In my job over the summer of 2023, I had a need to make a basic schedule. I disliked everything that I found for free online,
so I decided to just make my own! All it needs is a txt file of names, and it returns a CSV schedule! No one is scheduled for
back to back days, and everyone has an even amount of times they are scheduled. This helped out me and my fellow team members,
and I adjusted it and fixed it throughout the summer!

## End Goal
The reason I fell in love with programming is very simple: it's a unique way to solve problems. There are a lot of areas for improvement
in everyday life, and we can continue to create technologies to help people. Whether it be for an increase in mental health support 
or a way to maximize efficiency on public transportation, new technology can help immensely. The world is just waiting for people to create it, and I want to be a part of that team.
